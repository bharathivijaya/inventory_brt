<h3>Mission Statement:</h3>
<p>
    MyRxPal’s mission is to connect patients, pharmacies, healthcare providers and data for better pharmaceutical care and positive outcomes.
</p>
<h3>Who We Are:</h3>
<p>
    Founded in 2014, as existing independent pharmacy owners, we were looking for a solution to help better manage our practice and improve patient pharmaceutical care. We sought to identify cumbersome manual processes and make them accessible online, anywhere in an easy to use format without having to worry about software compatibility. Although our initial focus is to provide tools to fellow pharmacy owners to succeed in their practice, our ultimate goal is to make a positive impact on the patient’s they serve.
</p>
<h3>What We Do:</h3>
<p>
    Looking at the trend in pharmacy, medication adherence is an important contributing factor to maintaining a high quality rating. As payers will eventually use pharmacy quality scores to determine access to their networks or preferred providers, pharmacy owners and staff need the tools to succeed. We provide a powerful suite of cloud-based electronic pharmacy record, medication scheduling program and practice management tools such as narcotic eLogbook to manage inventory.
</p>
<p>
    All of our solutions are designed with usability at the forefront, from simple interfaces to 24/7 availability via any web browser. We extend a warm invitation to try us and thank you for being a valued member. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcomed as we strive to build the best software for you.
